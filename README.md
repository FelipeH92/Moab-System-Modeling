# Moab System Modeling Paper

This repo contains the Moab paper in different markup languages. The intention is to publish this content on the Moab microsite.


## Markdown + Math

Moab-Paper.md uses Markdown + Math VS Code extension (https://github.com/goessner/mdmath). The latex math does not render in Github.

Moab-Paper.html is the html source created from using Markdown + Math

## TexMe

Moab-Paper_TexMe.html uses TexMe (https://github.com/susam/texme) to render Markdown + Latex. The tables do not render properly. As a work around images have been used in place of the tables.
